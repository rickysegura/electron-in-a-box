# Quantum Particle in a Box Simulation

## Description

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of a quantum particle (electron) confined in a box, also known as the "particle in a box" or "infinite potential well" problem in quantum mechanics. Built using Three.js and Vite, this web-based application provides a visual representation of quantum mechanical concepts, making them more accessible and intuitive for students and enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Users can rotate, zoom, and pan the 3D scene to observe the particle's behavior from different angles.
- **Dynamic Particle Movement**: The electron's position is updated in real-time based on quantum mechanical principles.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Users can modify the energy level and box dimensions, observing how these changes affect the particle's behavior.
- **Particle Trail**: A trailing effect shows the recent path of the particle, helping visualize its movement over time.
- **Color-Changing Particle**: The particle's color changes based on its position within the box, providing additional visual feedback.
- **Coordinate Display**: Real-time x, y, and z coordinates of the particle are displayed, offering precise positional data.
- **Axis Planes and Labels**: Colored planes and labels for each axis (X, Y, Z) provide spatial context within the box.

## Educational Value

This simulation serves as an educational tool for:
- Visualizing the wave function and probability distribution of a particle in a 3D potential well
- Understanding how energy levels affect particle behavior in quantum systems
- Exploring the relationship between box dimensions and particle confinement
- Demonstrating key principles of quantum mechanics in an interactive, visual format

## Technology Stack
